## 🎯 How to Deploy for Production

### Step 1: Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates an `out/` folder with all static files.

### Step 2: Create Portable Package
**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click or run:
build-and-package.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x build-and-package.sh
./build-and-package.sh
```

### Step 3: Transfer to Target Computer
1. Copy the `ProjectFlow-Portable` folder to target computer
2. Install Node.js on target computer (if not already installed)
3. Install serve globally: `npm install -g serve`
4. Run the startup script
