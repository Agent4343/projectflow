# Detailed monday.com Clone Implementation Plan

## 1. Architecture Overview
- Build a self-contained, demo version of a project management platform inspired by monday.com.
- The application will have multiple pages: a Dashboard, Boards listing, and detailed Board views with both Kanban and table modes.
- Use existing Next.js file-based routing (in the src/app folder) and the shadcn/ui components for a modern, clean UI.
- Mock data will be provided via a new file (src/lib/mockData.ts) to simulate boards, tasks, and team members.
- Error handling and input validations will be implemented in dynamic pages and form components.

## 2. File and Component Changes

### a. Pages
- **Dashboard Page**
  - **File:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **Changes:**
    - Import UI components (e.g., Card, Button) from shadcn/ui.
    - Render summary cards from mock data (boards overview, task statuses, etc.).
    - Ensure responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes.
    - Wrap components in error boundaries to handle missing mock data gracefully.

- **Boards Listing Page**
  - **File:** `src/app/boards/page.tsx`
  - **Changes:**
    - Import and map through mock board data; for each board, render a `BoardCard` component.
    - Include a header ("Boards") and a "New Board" button (non-functional for the demo).
    - Use a grid layout for a modern dashboard feel.

- **Board Details Page (Dynamic Route)**
  - **File:** `src/app/boards/[boardId]/page.tsx`
  - **Changes:**
    - Retrieve the `boardId` from route parameters and load the corresponding board from mock data.
    - Implement a toggle (e.g., a pair of buttons) to switch between Kanban and table views.
    - When in Kanban view, render the `KanbanBoard` component; if table view is selected, render a basic table listing tasks.
    - Use proper error handling if the board is not found.

### b. UI Components
- **BoardCard Component**
  - **File:** `src/components/BoardCard.tsx`
  - **Changes:**
    - Accept board data as props and display board title, description, and a summary.
    - Use shadcn/ui Card layout and incorporate error handling for missing/undefined board properties.

- **TaskCard Component**
  - **File:** `src/components/TaskCard.tsx`
  - **Changes:**
    - Accept a task object as props and display task title, status, due date, etc.
    - Make the card clickable so that it opens the `TaskModal` for task details.

- **TaskModal Component**
  - **File:** `src/components/TaskModal.tsx`
  - **Changes:**
    - Utilize the Dialog component (from shadcn/ui) to create a popup form.
    - Include form fields: task title, description, due date, status, and assignee.
    - Implement form validations and display inline error messages.
    - Ensure accessibility (focus trap, keyboard navigation) and error handling during submission.

- **KanbanBoard Component**
  - **File:** `src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx`
  - **Changes:**
    - Accept column definitions (e.g., “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done”) and filter tasks from mock data accordingly.
    - Render each column as a flexible grid column and display `TaskCard` components within each.
    - Ensure responsive layout and provide graceful error fallback if a column contains no tasks.

### c. Mock Data and Utilities
- **Mock Data File**
  - **File:** `src/lib/mockData.ts`
  - **Changes:**
    - Define and export arrays for boards (each with an id, title, description, and tasks), tasks (with id, title, status, due date, and assignee), and team members.
    - This data will be imported in dashboard, boards, and board details pages.

- **Global Styles Update**
  - **File:** `src/app/globals.css`
  - **Changes:**
    - Add additional CSS classes (if needed) for grid layouts, spacing, and custom board-specific styling.
    - Ensure colors, typography, and spacing follow a modern and minimal design.

## 3. Error Handling & Best Practices
- Validate incoming data in dynamic routes with proper try/catch blocks or conditional rendering.
- In form components (TaskModal), validate input fields and show error messages without crashing the application.
- Use TypeScript interfaces/types for board and task data to ensure type safety.
- Follow accessibility standards for interactive UI elements like modals, buttons, and form inputs.

## 4. UI/UX Considerations
- Use clean typography, ample white space, and a grid-based layout to mimic a modern project management tool.
- Provide clear navigation between the Dashboard and Boards pages.
- Ensure toggle functionality in the Board Details page is intuitive and responsive.
- Avoid using external icons or image libraries; rely solely on refined UI component styles, typography, and layout.

## 5. Testing and Documentation
- Manually test routing and component rendering by running the development server.
- Update the README.md with instructions to run the demo and descriptions of new mock data and components.
- Optionally add basic unit tests for key components if tests are part of the best practices.

### Summary
- Created a self-contained monday.com clone using Next.js with pages for the Dashboard, Boards listing, and Board Details.
- Developed new components (BoardCard, TaskCard, TaskModal, and KanbanBoard) to handle project management UI.
- Designed a mockData file to simulate boards, tasks, and teams, ensuring error handling and type safety.
- Updated global styles for a modern, minimal design using typography and responsive layout.
- Integrated best practices for accessibility, state management, and error handling across components.
- Documented implementation details and testing steps in the README.
